## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- `pip` package manager
- `npm` package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- SQLite3 (included with Python)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pmvita/SecureNet.git
cd SecureNet
```

2. Set up Python virtual environment and install backend dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

4. Initialize the database:
```bash
python scripts/init_db.py
```

5. Generate an API key:
```bash
python scripts/generate_api_key.py
```

### Running the Application

The application consists of two parts: the backend API server and the frontend development server.

#### Development Mode Options

The frontend supports two distinct development modes controlled by the `VITE_MOCK_DATA` environment variable:

**Option 1: Mock Data Mode (Recommended for Development)**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev          # Uses comprehensive mock data, no backend required
# OR
npm run dev:mock     # Same as above, explicit mock mode
```
- **Features**: Complete mock data simulation including live network traffic, real-time anomalies, security scans, and log streams
- **Benefits**: Fast development without backend dependencies, realistic data for UI testing
- **Use Case**: Frontend development, UI/UX testing, component development

**Option 2: Real API Mode**
```bash
# First, start the backend server (in one terminal):
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
uvicorn app:app --reload

# Then start the frontend with real API calls (in another terminal):
cd frontend
npm run dev:api      # Connects to real backend API
```
- **Features**: Live data from backend services, real network monitoring, actual security scans
- **Benefits**: Full functionality testing, real data validation
- **Use Case**: Integration testing, backend development, production-like testing

#### Environment Configuration
The development mode is controlled by the `VITE_MOCK_DATA` environment variable:
- `VITE_MOCK_DATA=true` - Enables mock data mode with simulated real-time data
- `VITE_MOCK_DATA=false` - Connects to real backend APIs for live data

#### Quick Start (Mock Mode)
For quick development and testing without setting up the backend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will start the frontend with mock data at `http://localhost:5173`

#### Full Setup (Real API Mode)
For full functionality with real data:

1. Start the backend server (in one terminal):
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root and virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
# Or
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

2. Start the frontend with real API calls (in another terminal):
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev:api
```

The application will be available at:
- Backend API: `http://localhost:8000`
- Frontend UI: `http://localhost:5173`
- Username: admin
- Password: admin123
- Email: admin@example.com

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root based on `.env.example`:
```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
API_KEY=your-api-key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/securenet.db
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Development

#### Backend Development
- The backend is built with FastAPI and runs on port 8000
- API documentation is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- WebSocket endpoints are available at `ws://localhost:8000/ws/*`

#### Frontend Development
- The frontend is built with React + TypeScript and runs on port 5173
- Uses Vite for fast development and building
- Includes hot module replacement for quick development
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for styling
- React Query for data fetching
- React Router for navigation
- Jest and Testing Library for testing
- Storybook for component development

To run frontend tests:
```bash
