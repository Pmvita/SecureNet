# SecureNet Production Infrastructure

## Overview
SecureNet's production infrastructure is built on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and container orchestration (Kubernetes).

## Architecture
- **Compute**: Amazon EKS cluster with auto-scaling node groups
- **Database**: Amazon RDS PostgreSQL with Multi-AZ deployment
- **Cache**: Amazon ElastiCache Redis cluster
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 for backups and static files
- **Networking**: VPC with public/private subnets and NAT gateways
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer with SSL termination
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, and CloudWatch integration

## Deployment
Infrastructure is deployed using Terraform:
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="production.tfvars"
terraform apply
```

## Monitoring
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Visualization dashboards
- **AlertManager**: Alert routing and notification
- **CloudWatch**: AWS service monitoring

## Backup & Recovery
- **Database**: Automated daily backups with 30-day retention
- **Application**: Daily filesystem backups
- **Configuration**: Weekly Kubernetes resource backups
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 4 hours
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 1 hour

## Security
- **Network**: VPC with security groups and NACLs
- **Encryption**: At rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: IAM roles and RBAC
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and alerting

## Compliance
Infrastructure supports SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance requirements through:
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Data encryption and protection
- Access controls and monitoring
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
