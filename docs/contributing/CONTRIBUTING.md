## 🔧 **Development Guidelines**

### **Code Quality Standards**
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints, include docstrings
- **TypeScript/React**: Use strict TypeScript, functional components, proper props typing
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for new features, maintain >80% coverage
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs with your changes

### **Security Considerations**
- **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, passwords, certificates)
- **Validate all inputs** in both frontend and backend
- **Follow secure coding practices** for authentication and data handling
- **Test security features** in isolated environments

### **Git Workflow**
```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# Make commits with clear messages
git commit -m "feat: add AI threat detection enhancement"
git commit -m "fix: resolve CVE API timeout issue"
git commit -m "docs: update installation guide"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing Requirements**

### **Backend Testing**
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/test_auth.py
pytest tests/test_network_scanner.py
pytest tests/test_cve_integration.py
```

### **Frontend Testing**
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

### **Integration Testing**
- Test with real network environments
- Validate AI/ML model performance
- Verify WebSocket connections
