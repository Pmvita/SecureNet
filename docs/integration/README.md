# Integration Phases

Strategic implementation phases for enhancing SecureNet with awesome-python libraries.

## ðŸ“‹ Phase Overview

| Phase | Focus | Priority | Libraries |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Phase 1** | Observability | High | Sentry, Structlog, Celery |
| **Phase 2** | Developer Experience | Medium | MLflow, Hypothesis, DI frameworks |
| **Phase 3** | Advanced Tooling | Low | OpenTelemetry, wandb, specialized tools |

## ðŸ“š Phase Guides

### [Phase 1: Observability](phase-1-observability.md)
Essential production monitoring, error tracking, and background task processing.

### [Phase 2: Developer Experience](phase-2-developer-experience.md)
ML lifecycle management, testing frameworks, and code architecture improvements.

### [Phase 3: Advanced Tooling](phase-3-advanced-tooling.md)
Distributed tracing, advanced experiment tracking, and specialized integrations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Strategy

1. **Sequential Implementation**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
2. **Modular Design**: Each integration is self-contained and non-disruptive
3. **Production Ready**: All integrations include production configuration examples
4. **Testing First**: Each phase includes testing and validation steps
