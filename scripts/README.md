## 📋 **Subdirectory Overview**

### **validation/** - Sprint Validation Scripts
- **Purpose**: Automated validation of sprint deliverables
- **Usage**: `python scripts/validation/week5_day1_validation.py`
- **Coverage**: All sprint weeks and days with comprehensive testing

### **migrations/** - Database Migration Scripts  
- **Purpose**: Database schema changes and data migrations
- **Usage**: `python scripts/migrations/[migration_script].py`
- **Safety**: Includes rollback procedures and data validation

### **deployment/** - Production Deployment Scripts
- **Purpose**: CI/CD, blue-green deployment, and production automation
- **Usage**: Integrated with GitHub Actions and deployment pipelines
- **Features**: Zero-downtime deployment and automated rollback

### **monitoring/** - System Monitoring Scripts
- **Purpose**: Health checks, performance monitoring, and alerting
- **Usage**: Background jobs and scheduled monitoring tasks
- **Coverage**: User management, system health, and compliance monitoring

## 🔧 **Usage Guidelines**

### **Running Validation Scripts**
```bash
# Run specific week validation
python scripts/validation/week5_day1_validation.py

# Run all validations (if available)
python scripts/validation/run_all_validations.py
```

### **Database Operations**
```bash
# Initialize database
python scripts/init_db.py

# Run migrations
python scripts/migrations/[specific_migration].py

# Update database schema
python scripts/update_db.py
```

### **Feature Implementation**
```bash
# Implement new features
python scripts/create_[feature_name].py

# Monitor system health
python scripts/monitoring/[monitoring_script].py
```

### **Enterprise Production Startup**
```bash
# Enterprise startup with comprehensive validation
python scripts/start_enterprise.py

# Health endpoints verification
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/system/status

# Exit codes for CI/CD automation
# 0 = Success, 1 = Failure
python scripts/start_enterprise.py --check  # Returns proper exit codes

# Validation CLI commands
python scripts/start_enterprise.py --validate-roles    # Role validation
python scripts/start_enterprise.py --health-check      # Health verification  
python scripts/start_enterprise.py --compliance-audit  # Compliance check
```

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **Before Running Scripts**
1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure proper virtual environment activation
2. **Database Backup**: Always backup database before migration scripts
3. **Configuration Check**: Verify environment variables and configuration
4. **Dependency Install**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### **Production Considerations**
- **Test First**: Always test scripts in development/staging first
- **Rollback Plan**: Have rollback procedures ready for critical changes
- **Monitoring**: Monitor system health during and after script execution
- **Documentation**: Update documentation after successful script execution
