# Migration Scripts Directory

> **Database Migration and Schema Management Scripts**  
> *Safe and reliable database schema evolution for SecureNet*

---

## 📋 **Overview**

This directory contains database migration scripts that handle schema changes, data transformations, and system upgrades in a safe, reversible manner.

---

## 📁 **Migration Scripts**

### **Current Migration Scripts**
```
migrations/
├── create_user_groups_migration.py     # User groups and memberships
├── week4_day4_simple_migration.py      # Week 4 Day 4 schema updates
└── [future migration scripts]
```

---

## 🎯 **Migration Types**

### **📊 Schema Migrations**
- Table creation and modification
- Index creation and optimization
- Column additions and modifications
- Constraint management

### **🔄 Data Migrations**
- Data transformation and cleanup
- Record migration between tables
- Data validation and integrity checks
- Bulk data operations

### **🔧 System Migrations**
- Configuration updates
- Feature flag management
- Environment-specific changes
- Performance optimizations

---

## 🚀 **Usage Instructions**

### **Running Migrations**
```bash
# Run specific migration
python scripts/migrations/create_user_groups_migration.py

# Run with dry-run mode (preview changes)
python scripts/migrations/create_user_groups_migration.py --dry-run

# Run with verbose output
python scripts/migrations/create_user_groups_migration.py --verbose
```

### **Migration Safety**
```bash
# Always backup before migration
python scripts/migrations/backup_database.py

# Run migration with rollback capability
python scripts/migrations/[migration_script].py --with-rollback

# Verify migration success
python scripts/migrations/verify_migration.py [migration_name]
```

## 🛡️ **Safety Features**

### **Pre-Migration Checks**
- Database backup verification
- Schema compatibility validation
- Dependency requirement checks
- Environment safety validation

### **Transaction Safety**
- All migrations run in transactions
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Checkpoint creation for large operations
- Data integrity validation

### **Rollback Procedures**
- Each migration includes rollback capability
- Rollback scripts generated automatically
- State verification before and after
- Emergency rollback procedures

---

## 📊 **Migration Tracking**

### **Migration History**
Each migration is tracked with:
- **Migration ID**: Unique identifier
- **Execution Time**: When migration was run
- **Success Status**: Pass/fail status
- **Rollback Status**: Rollback availability
- **Schema Version**: Database version after migration

### **Migration Log Example**
```
Migration: create_user_groups_migration.py
Status: SUCCESS
Executed: 2024-12-20 10:30:00
Duration: 2.3 seconds
Tables Created: user_groups, user_group_memberships
Records Affected: 150 users, 10 groups
Rollback Available: YES
```

---

## 🔧 **Migration Framework**

### **Base Migration Class**
All migrations inherit from a common base providing:
- Transaction management
- Error handling and logging
- Rollback capability
- Progress tracking
- Validation methods

### **Migration Lifecycle**
1. **Pre-flight Checks**: Validate environment and prerequisites
2. **Backup Creation**: Create database backup
3. **Schema Validation**: Verify current schema state
4. **Migration Execution**: Apply changes in transaction
5. **Post-migration Validation**: Verify changes were applied correctly
6. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary resources

---

## 📈 **Migration Best Practices**

### **Development Guidelines**
- **Incremental Changes**: Make small, focused migrations
- **Reversible Operations**: Always provide rollback capability
- **Data Preservation**: Never lose existing data
- **Performance Awareness**: Consider impact on large datasets

### **Testing Requirements**
- Test migrations on development environment
- Validate rollback procedures
- Test with production-like data volumes
- Verify performance impact

### **Documentation Standards**
- Clear migration purpose and scope
- Detailed rollback procedures
- Performance impact assessment
- Dependencies and requirements

---

## 🚨 **Emergency Procedures**

### **Migration Failure Recovery**
```bash
# Stop application immediately
python scripts/ops/stop_application.py

# Assess migration status
python scripts/migrations/assess_migration_status.py

# Rollback if safe
python scripts/migrations/rollback_migration.py [migration_id]

# Restore from backup if needed
python scripts/migrations/restore_from_backup.py [backup_id]
```

### **Production Migration Checklist**
- [ ] Database backup completed and verified
- [ ] Migration tested in staging environment
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested and documented
- [ ] Application downtime window scheduled
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Team on standby for emergency response
