## 📊 **Monitoring Framework**

### **Base Monitor Class**
All monitoring scripts inherit from a common base providing:
- Standardized logging and reporting
- Alert generation and routing
- Configuration management
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance metrics collection

### **Monitoring Lifecycle**
1. **Data Collection**: Gather metrics from various sources
2. **Threshold Evaluation**: Compare metrics against defined thresholds
3. **Alert Generation**: Create alerts for threshold violations
4. **Notification Routing**: Send alerts to appropriate channels
5. **Metric Storage**: Store metrics for historical analysis
6. **Report Generation**: Create summary reports and dashboards

---

## 🔧 **Configuration Management**

### **Monitoring Configuration**
```yaml
# Example monitoring configuration
monitoring:
  account_expiration:
    check_interval: "1h"
    warning_days: [30, 14, 7, 3, 1]
    alert_channels: ["email", "slack"]
    
  system_health:
    check_interval: "5m"
    cpu_threshold: 80
    memory_threshold: 85
    disk_threshold: 90
    
  security:
    failed_login_threshold: 5
    suspicious_activity_window: "15m"
    alert_channels: ["email", "pagerduty"]
```

### **Threshold Management**
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Automatically adjust based on historical data
- **Environment-Specific**: Different thresholds for dev/staging/prod
- **Time-Based**: Different thresholds for business hours vs. off-hours
- **User-Defined**: Custom thresholds for specific requirements

---

## 📈 **Metrics and Dashboards**

### **Key Performance Indicators**
- **System Uptime**: 99.9% availability target
- **Response Time**: <200ms average API response
- **Error Rate**: <0.1% error rate target
- **User Satisfaction**: Performance and reliability metrics

### **Dashboard Categories**
- **Executive Dashboard**: High-level KPIs and business metrics
- **Operations Dashboard**: System health and performance metrics
- **Security Dashboard**: Security events and compliance status
- **User Management Dashboard**: User activity and account status

### **Metrics Collection**
```python
# Example metrics collection
metrics = {
    'active_users': count_active_users(),
    'api_response_time': measure_api_performance(),
    'database_connections': get_db_connection_count(),
    'memory_usage': get_system_memory_usage(),
    'disk_usage': get_disk_usage_percentage()
}
```
